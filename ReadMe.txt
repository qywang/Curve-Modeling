1. To compile the project, you need to run the following commands:


1) use cd and ls to find the path of makefile and the cpp file

2) make -f makefile (To make a makefile)

3)./HW3 (Run the project)



Then, you will see the menu for different methods. The subdivision is in the 2nd choice: de casteljsu algorithm.

2. To make it more convenient to run, the points have already been set in the codes. To imput the points, you need to select 'y' when being asked for "Do you want to input the points?"
To satisfy the 'cubic' property, only 6 or 8 control points'inputs are supportive.
The input format example is as the following:(you can use either 'space' or 'enter' to seperate the input of each point)

			0.8 0.5
			-0.6 0.6
			-0.3 -0.6
			0.2 0.3
			0.4 0.3
			0.6 -0.5
